This project was originally developed as part of the NCI caBIG initiative. 
The Princeton, NJ office of Siemens Corporate Research provided the intial master build
as part of the AVT project. The Electronic Radiology Laboratory at the Mallinckrodt Institute
of Radiology of Washington University in St. Louis led later development and expansion of 
the project to include all of XIP and AVT. 
The project's web home is found at http://www.OpenXIP.org.


In 2013, as part of the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) Open Development Initiative,
the XIP and AVT source code and documentation was consolidated onto imphub.org to foster
future development by a broader community.  The source code was also mirrored to GitHub to 
facilitate distribution to and contributions from a wide audience.
